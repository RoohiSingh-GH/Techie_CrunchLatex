\section{Our Vision and Concept}
\begin{abstract}
   Breathe in. Breathe out.
The state of the world is, in short, chaos. Your mental state does not have to be the same. It sounds counter intuitive,
but the very device that is delivering anxiety-inducing news could be the thing that brings you a bit of calm. Meditation apps are a welcome window into a world of gentle bells, chirping birds, and encouraging words. Beyond the peaceful imagery, the ceasing of the mind’s worry with meditation can have tremendous health benefits, easing anxiety, depression, and pain and even improving immunity.
Team Techie Crunch intends to produce an Android App named ”CALM-DOWN” that will take a quiz from user to know their anxiety, stress level and helps them to calm-down. It has some modern and ancient music to cheer-up as well as some motivational videos. It has yoga and meditation sessions which helps them to be fit and happy. It also has a journal for writing all their experiences and good things happening around them, So they can motivate others. An annual membership (45 Dollars) gives access to a short course on how to meditate, videos and stories about meditation, and instructions on how to guide others in meditation.
Our Vision is that this product will be of value to customers which helps to reveal the diamond nature of your own mind, so your appreciation of it can be more direct and intimate, and not covered up with all the stuff that keeps it from shining.
